# healthchecks-rs

Rust crates for working with [healthchecks.io]. The repository contains these crates:

- [healthchecks]: A library that provides a type-safe way to access to the [healthchecks.io] pinging and management APIs. Currently covers all methods, please file an issue if a new one is added.
- [healthchecks-monitor]: A CLI tool that uses [healthchecks] to interface with the pinging API.
- [hcctl]: Another CLI tool, which utilises a subset of the management API to let users list current checks and get their last 10 pings.
